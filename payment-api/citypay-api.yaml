  title: CityPay Payment API
  description: |

    This CityPay API is a HTTP RESTful payment API used for direct server to server transactional processing. It
    provides a number of payment mechanisms including: Internet, MOTO, Continuous Authority transaction processing,
    3-D Secure decision handling using RFA Secure, Authorisation, Refunding, Pre-Authorisation, Cancellation/Voids and
    Completion processing. The API is also capable of tokinsed payments using Card Holder Accounts.

    ## Compliance and Security
    <aside class="notice">
      Before we begin a reminder that your application will need to adhere to PCI-DSS standards to operate safely
      and to meet requirements set out by Visa and MasterCard and the PCI Security Standards Council including:
    </aside>

    * Data must be collected using TLS version 1.2 using [strong cryptography](#enabled-tls-ciphers). We will not accept calls to our API at
      lower grade encryption levels. We regularly scan our TLS endpoints for vulnerabilities and perform TLS assessments
      as part of our compliance program.
    * The application must not store sensitive card holder data (CHD) such as the card security code (CSC) or
      primary access number (PAN)
    * The application must not display the full card number on receipts, it is recommended to mask the PAN
      and show the last 4 digits. The API will return this for you for ease of receipt creation
    * If you are developing a website, you will be required to perform regular scans on the network where you host the
      application to meet your compliance obligations
    * You will be required to be PCI Compliant and the application must adhere to the security standard. Further information
      is available from [https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/)
    * The API verifies that the request is for a valid account and originates from a trusted source using the remote IP
      address. Our application firewalls analyse data that may be an attempt to break a large number of security common
      security vulnerabilities..

    description: |
      Batch processing uses the Batch and Instalment Service (BIS) which allows for transaction processing against cardholder 
      accounts using a dynamic batch file. For merchants who process on schedules and dynamic amounts, the service allows for 
      the presentation of cardholder account references and transaction requirements to run as a scheduled batch.
  - name: Card Holder Account
    description: |
      A cardholder account models a cardholder and can register 1 or more cards for tokenised charging. 
      
      The account offers a credential on file option to the CityPay gateway allowing for both cardholder initiated and 
      merchant initiated transaction processing.
      
      This can include unscheduled or scheduled transactions that can be requested through this API and include batch 
      processing options.

      The Payment Processing API offers standard and enhanced payment processing for MOTO, e-commerce
       and continuous authority transactions that include fraud and risk checking, 3D-Secure flows 
       and payment querying.

        _The capture process only applies to transactions which have been pre-authorised only._ 
        
        The capture process will ensure

        a maximum of 7 days.
        
        A capture request is provided to confirm that you wish the transaction to be settled. This request can
        contain a final amount for the transaction which is different to the original authorisation amount. This
        may be useful in a delayed system process such as waiting for stock to be ordered, confirmed, or services
        provided before the final cost is known.
        
        When a transaction is completed, a new authorisation code may be created and a new confirmation
        can be sent online to the acquiring bank.
        
        Once the transaction has been processed. A standard [`Acknowledgement`](#acknowledgement) will be returned,
        outlining the result of the transaction. On a successful completion process, the transaction will
        be available for the settlement and completed at the end of the day.

        A bin range lookup service can be used to check what a card is, as seen by the gateway. Each card number's 
        leading digits help to identify who
        
        0. the card scheme is such as Visa, MasterCard or American Express 
        1. the issuer of the card, such as the bank
        2. it's country of origin
        3. it's currency of origin
        
        Our gateway has 450 thousand possible bin ranges and uses a number of algorithms to determine the likelihood of the bin
        data. The request requires a bin value of between 6 and 12 digits. The more digits provided may ensure a more accurate
        result.

        The CRes request performs authorisation processing once a challenge request has been completed
        with an Authentication Server (ACS). This challenge response contains confirmation that will
        allow the API systems to return an authorisation response based on the result. Our systems will 
        know out of band via an `RReq` call by the ACS to notify us if the liability shift has been issued.
        
        Any call to the CRes operation will require a previous authorisation request and cannot be called 
        on its own without a previous [request challenge](#requestchallenged) being obtained.

      operationId: AuthorisationRequest
      description: |
        An authorisation process performs a standard transaction authorisation based on the provided parameters of its request.
        The CityPay gateway will route your transaction via an Acquiring bank for subsequent authorisation to the appropriate card 
        schemes such as Visa or MasterCard.
        
        The authorisation API should be used for server environments to process transactions on demand and in realtime. 
        
        The authorisation API can be used for multiple types of transactions including E-commerce, mail order, telephone order,
        customer present (keyed), continuous authority, pre-authorisation and others. CityPay will configure your account for 
        the appropriate coding and this will perform transparently by the gateway. 
        
        Data properties that are required, may depend on the environment you are conducting payment for. Our API aims to be
         flexible enough to cater for these structures. Our integration team will aid you in providing the necessary data to 
         transact. 
         
         
        ## E-commerce workflows
         
        For E-commerce transactions requiring 3DS, the API contains a fully accredited in built mechanism to handle authentication.
        
        The Api and gateway has been accredited extensively with both Acquirers and Card Schemes to simplify the nature of these calls
        into a simple structure for authentication, preventing integrators from performing lengthy and a costly accreditations with
        Visa and MasterCard.
        
        3D-secure has been around for a number of years and aims to shift the liability of a transaction away from a merchant back
        to the card holder. A *liability shift* determines whether a card holder can charge back a transaction as unknown. Effectively
        the process asks for a card holder to authenticate the transaction prior to authorisation producing a Cardholder 
        verification value (CAVV) and ecommerce indicator (ECI) as evidence of authorisation.
        
        3DS version 1 has now been replaced by 3DS version 2 to provide secure customer authentication (SCA) in line with EU regulation.
        3DSv2 is being phased out and any accounts using version 1 of the protocol is expected to be migrated by March 2022. 
        
        Any new integrations should only consider 3DSv2 flows. 
        
        ### 3DSv2
        
        ```json
        {

          }               
        }
        ```

        </RequestChallenged>
        ```
        
        CityPay support 3DS version 2.1 for Verified by Visa, MasterCard Identity Check and American Express SafeKey 2.1. Version
        2.2 is currently in development however this will be a seamless upgrade for all integrations.
        
        #### 3-D Secure - None
        
        ![3DSv2 Frctionless Flow](/images/3dsv2-no3d.png)
        
        A basic flow may involve no 3-D secure processing. This could happen if there is no ability to perform authentication.
        An enrollment check may apply an "attempted" resolution to processing. In this instance a transaction may not meet any
        liability shift. A transaction may result in a decline due to this. We are also able to prevent from transactions being
        presented for authorisation if this occurs. 
        
        #### 3-D Secure - Frictionless
        
        ![3DSv2 Frctionless Flow](/images/3dsv2-frictionless.png)
        
        E-commerce transactions supporting 3DSv2 can benefit from seamlessly authenticated transactions which may perform a 
        "frictionless" flow. This method will authenticate low risk transactions with minimal impact to a 
        standard authorisation flow. Our API simply performs this on behalf of you the developer, the merchant and cardholder.
        
        No redirection occurs and hence the flow is called frictionless and will appear as though a simple transaction 
        authorisation has occurred.
        
        #### 3-D Secure - Challenge
        
        ![3DSv2 Frctionless Flow](/images/3dsv2-challenge.png)
        
        A transaction that is deemed as higher risk my be "challenged". In this instance, the API will return a
        [request challenge](#requestchallenged) which will require your integration to forward the cardholder's browser to the 
        given [ACS url](#acsurl). This should be performed by posting the [creq](#creq) value (the challenge request value). 
        
        Once complete, the ACS will have already been in touch with our servers by sending us a result of the authentication
        known as `RReq`.
        
        To maintain session state, a parameter `threeDSSessionData` can be posted to the ACS url and will be returned alongside 
        the `CRes` value. This will ensure that any controller code will be able to isolate state between calls. This field
        is to be used by your own systems rather than ours and may be any value which can uniquely identify your cardholder's
        session. As an option, we do provide a `threedserver_trans_id` value in the `RequestChallenged` packet which can be used
        for the `threeDSSessionData` value as it is used to uniquely identify the 3D-Secure session. 
        
        A common method of maintaining state is to provide a session related query string value in the `merchant_termurl` value
        (also known as the `notificationUrl`). For example providing a url of `https://mystore.com/checkout?token=asny2348w4561..`
        could return the user directly back to their session with your environment.
        
        Once you have received a `cres` post from the ACS authentication service, this should be POSTed to the [cres](#cres) 
        endpoint to perform full authorisation processing. 
        
        Please note that the CRes returned to us is purely a mechanism of acknowledging that transactions should be committed for
        authorisation. The ACS by this point will have sent us the verification value (CAVV) to perform a liability shift. The CRes
        value will be validated for receipt of the CAVV and subsequently may return response codes illustrating this. 
        
        To forward the user to the ACS, we recommend a simple auto submit HTML form.
        
        > Simple auto submit HTML form
        
        ```html
        <html lang="en">

                    document.acs.submit(); 
                }
                </script>
                <noscript>You will require JavaScript to be enabled to complete this transaction</noscript>
            </head>
            <body onload="onLoadEvent();">
                <form name="acs" action="{{ACSURL from Response}}" method="POST">
                    <input type="hidden" name="creq" value="{{CReq Packet from Response}}" />
                    <input type="hidden" name="threeDSSessionData" value="{{session-identifier}}" />
                </form>
            </body>
        </html>
        ```
        
        A full ACS test suite is available for 3DSv2 testing.
                
        ### Testing 3DSv2 Integrations
        
        The API provides a mock 3dsV2 handler which performs a number of scenarios based on the value of the CSC in the request.
        
        | CSC Value | Behaviour |
        |-----------|-----------|
        | 731       | Frictionless processing - Not authenticated |
        | 732       | Frictionless processing - Account verification count not be performed |        
        | 733       | Frictionless processing - Verification Rejected |        
        | 741       | Frictionless processing - Attempts Processing |        
        | 750       | Frictionless processing - Authenticated  |        
        | 761       | Triggers an error message |  
        | Any       | Challenge Request |       
        
        
        #### 3DSv1
        
        **Please note that 3DSv1 should now be considered as deprecated.**
        
        ```json
        { 
          "AuthenticationRequired": {
            "acsurl": "https://bank.com/3DS/ACS",
            "pareq": "SXQgd2FzIHRoZSBiZXN0IG9mIHRpbWVzLCBpdCB3YXMgdGhlIHdvcnN00...",
            "md": "WQgZXZlcnl0aGluZyBiZW"
          }               
        }
        ```
        
        ```xml
        <AuthenticationRequired>
         <acsurl>https://bank.com/3DS/ACS</acsurl>
         <pareq>SXQgd2FzIHRoZSBiZXN0IG9mIHRpbWVzLCBpdCB3YXMgdGhlIHdvcnN00...</pareq>
         <md>WQgZXZlcnl0aGluZyBiZW</md>
        </AuthenticationRequired>
        ```
        
        For E-commerce transactions requiring 3DSv1, the API contains a built in MPI which will be called to check whether the
        card is participating in 3DSv1 with Verified by Visa or MasterCard SecureCode. We only support Amex SafeKey with 3DSv2. Should the card be enrolled, a payer
        request (PAReq) value will be created and returned back as an [authentication required](#authenticationrequired) response object.
        
        Your system will need to process this authentication packet and forward the user's browser to an authentication server (ACS)
        to gain the user's authentication. Once complete, the ACS will produce a HTTP `POST` call back to the URL supplied in
        the authentication request as `merchant_termurl`. This URL should behave as a controller and handle the post data from the
        ACS and on a forked server to server HTTP request, forward this data to the [pares authentication url](#pares) for
        subsequent authorisation processing. You may prefer to provide a processing page whilst this is being processed.
        Processing with our systems should be relatively quick and be between 500ms - 3000ms however it is desirable to let
        the user see that something is happening rather than a pending browser.
        
        The main reason for ensuring that this controller is two fold:
        
        1. We are never in control of the user's browser in a server API call
        2. The controller is actioned on your site to ensure that any post actions from authorisation can be executed in real time
        
        To forward the user to the ACS, we recommend a simple auto submit HTML form.

                    document.acs.submit();

                    <input type="hidden" name="TermUrl" value="{{Your Controller}}" />
                    <input type="hidden" name="MD" value="{{MD From Response}}" />
                </form>
            </body>
        </html>
        ```
        
        Please note that 3DSv1 is being phased out due to changes to strong customer authentication mechanisms. 3DSv2 addresses
        this and will solidify the authorisation and confirmation process.
        
        We provide a Test ACS for full 3DSv1 integration testing that simulates an ACS.

        returns up to the first 5 transactions in the latest date time order.
        
        It is not intended for this operation to be a replacement for reporting and only allows for base transaction
        information to be returned.

        - Card Holder Account
      operationId: ChargeRequest
      description: |
        A charge process obtains an authorisation using a tokenised value which represents a stored card 
        on a card holder account. 
        A card must previously be registered by calling `/account-register-card` with the card details 
        or retrieved using `/account-retrieve`
        
        Tokens are generated whenever a previously registered list of cards are retrieved. Each token has, by design a 
        relatively short time to live of 30 minutes. This is both to safe guard the merchant and card holder from 
        replay attacks. Tokens are also restricted to your account, preventing malicious actors from stealing details
        for use elsewhere.  
        
        If a token is reused after it has expired it will be rejected and a new token will be required.
         
        Tokenisation can be used for
         
        - repeat authorisations on a previously stored card
        - easy authorisations just requiring CSC values to be entered
        - can be used for credential on file style payments
        - can require full 3-D Secure authentication to retain the liability shift
        - wallet style usage
         
        
        _Should an account be used with 3DSv2, the card holder name should also be stored alongside the card as this is a
        required field with both Visa and MasterCard for risk analysis._.

            Merchant-initiated transactions (MITs) are payments you trigger, where the cardholder has previously consented
            to you carrying out such payments. These may be scheduled (such as recurring payments and installments) or
            unscheduled (like account top-ups triggered by balance thresholds and no-show charges).
            
            Scheduled
            ---
            These are regular payments using stored card details, like installments or a monthly subscription fee.
            
            - `I` Instalment - A single purchase of goods or services billed to a cardholder in multiple transactions, over a period of time agreed by the cardholder and you.
            
            - `R` Recurring - Transactions processed at fixed, regular intervals not to exceed one year between transactions, representing an agreement between a cardholder and you to purchase goods or services provided over a period of time.
            
            Unscheduled
            ---
            These are payments using stored card details that do not occur on a regular schedule, like top-ups for a
            digital wallet triggered by the balance falling below a certain threshold.
            
            - `A` Reauthorisation - a purchase made after the original purchase. A common scenario is delayed/split shipments.
            
            - `C` Unscheduled Payment - A transaction using a stored credential for a fixed or variable amount that does not occur on a scheduled or regularly occurring transaction date. This includes account top-ups triggered by balance thresholds.
            
            - `D` Delayed Charge - A delayed charge is typically used in hotel, cruise lines and vehicle rental environments to perform a supplemental account charge after original services are rendered.
            
            - `L` Incremental - An incremental authorisation is typically found in hotel and car rental environments, where the cardholder has agreed to pay for any service incurred during the duration of the contract. An incremental authorisation is where you need to seek authorisation of further funds in addition to what you have originally requested. A common scenario is additional services charged to the contract, such as extending a stay in a hotel.
            
            - `S` Resubmission - When the original purchase occurred, but you were not able to get authorisation at the time the goods or services were provided. It should be only used where the goods or services have already been provided, but the authorisation request is declined for insufficient funds.
            
            - `X` No-show - A no-show is a transaction where you are enabled to charge for services which the cardholder entered into an agreement to purchase, but the cardholder did not meet the terms of the agreement.
        csc: 
          type: string
          minLength: 3

          example: 012
          description: |
            The Card Security Code (CSC) (also known as CV2/CVV2) is normally found on the back of the card
            (American Express has it on the front). The value helps to identify posession of the card as it is not
            available within the chip or magnetic swipe.
            
            When forwarding the CSC, please ensure the value is a string as some values start with 0 and this will be stripped
            out by any integer parsing.
            
            The CSC number aids fraud prevention in Mail Order and Internet payments.
            
            Business rules are available on your account to identify whether to accept
            or decline transactions based on mismatched results of the CSC.
            
            The Payment Card Industry (PCI) requires that at no stage of a transaction should the CSC be stored.
            
            This applies to all entities handling card data.
            
            It should also not be used in any hashing process.
            
            CityPay do not store the value and have no method of retrieving the value once the transaction has been processed.
            For this reason, duplicate checking is unable to determine the CSC in its duplication check algorithm.

          type: string
          description: |
            A policy value which determines whether a duplication policy is enforced or bypassed. A duplication check has a window
            of time set against your account within which it can action. If a previous transaction with matching values occurred within
            the window, any subsequent transaction will result in a T001 result.
            
            Values are
             `0` for the default policy (default value if not supplied). Your default values are determined by your account manager on setup of the account.
            
             `1` for an enforced policy. Transactions that are enforced will be checked for duplication within the duplication window.
            
             `2` to bypass. Transactions that are bypassed will not be checked for duplication within the duplication window.
            
             `3` to ignore. Transactions that are ignored will have the same affect as bypass.

            The identifier of the transaction to process. The value should be a valid reference and may be used to perform
             post processing actions and to aid in reconciliation of transactions.
            
            The value should be a valid printable string with ASCII character ranges from 0x32 to 0x127.
            
            The identifier is recommended to be distinct for each transaction such as a [random unique identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier)
            this will aid in ensuring each transaction is identifiable.
            
            When transactions are processed they are also checked for duplicate requests. Changing the identifier on a subsequent
            request will ensure that a transaction is considered as different.

          type: string
          maxLength: 1
          description: |
            Transactions charged using the API are defined as:
            
            **Cardholder Initiated**: A _cardholder initiated transaction_ (CIT) is where the cardholder selects the
            card for use for a purchase using previously stored details. An example would be a customer buying an item from
            your website after being present with their saved card details at checkout.
            
            **Merchant Intiated**: A _merchant initiated transaction_ (MIT) is an authorisation initiated where you as the
             merchant submit a cardholders previously stored details without the cardholder's participation. An example would
             be a subscription to a membership scheme to debit their card monthly.
            
            MITs have different reasons such as reauthorisation, delayed, unscheduled, incremental, recurring, instalment, no-show or resubmission.
            
            The following values apply
            
             - `M` - specifies that the transaction is initiated by the merchant
            
             - `C` - specifies that the transaction is initiated by the cardholder
            
            Where transactions are merchant initiated, a valid cardholder agreement must be defined.

             `1` for an enforced policy. Transactions that are enforced will be rejected if the AVS address numeric value does not match.
            
             `2` to bypass. Transactions that are bypassed will be allowed through even if the address did not match.
            
             `3` to ignore. Transactions that are ignored will bypass the result and not send address numeric details for authorisation.

          description: |
            The Card Security Code (CSC) (also known as CV2/CVV2) is normally found on the back of the card
            (American Express has it on the front). The value helps to identify posession of the card as it is not
            available within the chip or magnetic swipe.
            
            When forwarding the CSC, please ensure the value is a string as some values start with 0 and this will be stripped
            out by any integer parsing.
            
            The CSC number aids fraud prevention in Mail Order and Internet payments.
            
            Business rules are available on your account to identify whether to accept
            or decline transactions based on mismatched results of the CSC.
            
            The Payment Card Industry (PCI) requires that at no stage of a transaction should the CSC be stored.
            
            This applies to all entities handling card data.
            
            It should also not be used in any hashing process.
            
            CityPay do not store the value and have no method of retrieving the value once the transaction has been processed.
            For this reason, duplicate checking is unable to determine the CSC in its duplication check algorithm.

            the window, any subsequent transaction will result in a T001 result.
            
            Values are

            The identifier is recommended to be distinct for each transaction such as a [random unique identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier)
            this will aid in ensuring each transaction is identifiable.
            
            When transactions are processed they are also checked for duplicate requests. Changing the identifier on a subsequent

      description: |
        The `cp-api-key` authentication header is required for all payment processing access.
         All calls using this key will be validated against white listed IP addressing
         and calls are scrutinised by the CityPay application firewall for security protection
         and attack mitigation.

         A key has been designed to:
         - be temporal and time based. The key rotates frequently to protect against replay attacks and to ensure a
           computation derives your client details from the request
         - to remain secret, the key value is your access permission to process transactions and
           although we have preventative measures to protect the key, undue exposure is not desirable
         - to allow processing against multiple merchant accounts that belong to your CityPay account.
         - to use a HTTP header value to protect undue logging mechanisms from logging data packet values and
           logically seperates authentication concerns from the body of data.
         - keys typically have a TTL of 5 minutes in production and 20 minutes in Sandbox. 
         - keys should be rotated often and is recommended on each API call
      in: header
