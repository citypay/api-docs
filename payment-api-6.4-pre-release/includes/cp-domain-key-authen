<p><strong>cp-domain-key</strong></p>

<p>path <code>cp-domain-key</code></p>

<p>The <code>cp-domain-key</code> authentication is required for host based authentication where integrations
are over direct HTTPS calls.
Calls using this key will be validated against a prefixed list of host addresses and the <code>Origin</code> or <code>Referer</code>
header of the HTTP call checked.
All calls are scrutinised by the CityPay application firewall for security protection
and attack mitigation.</p>

<p>A key has been designed to:
- be added to a HTML Form as an authentication token for a pre-registered domain.
- Allow for the registration of multiple domains
- Only calls which are host based may use a domain key</p>
